# To-Do List App

## Broad points to achieve

- empty form with a + button to add a new item
- navigation bar (left panel) with entries that collapse by some time metric
- when creating to-do item, allow for repetition (fixed or custom period)

## Task logic

- task submit button sends task to a project array (obj maybe?)
- tasks in a project should auto order by due date (bonus add options for other ordering)
- which project tasks are going into
